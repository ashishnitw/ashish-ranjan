A guide to creating a minimal, elegant portfolio website using React and Vite.

## Introduction

Creating a portfolio website is an essential step for developers to showcase their skills and projects. In this guide, we'll explore how to build a clean, modern portfolio using React and Vite.

## Why React?

React provides several advantages for building a portfolio:

- **Component-based architecture**: Easy to manage and reuse components
- **Fast rendering**: Efficient updates with virtual DOM
- **Rich ecosystem**: Access to thousands of libraries and tools
- **Great developer experience**: Hot module replacement and excellent tooling

## Setting Up Your Project

Start by creating a new Vite project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-portfolio -- --template react
cd my-portfolio
npm install
```

## Key Components

### 1. Navigation
A simple navigation bar at the top of your site helps users explore your content.

### 2. Hero Section
This is your first impression. Make it count with a compelling headline and call-to-action.

### 3. Projects Section
Showcase your best work with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or repositories.

### 4. Articles/Blog
Share your knowledge and thoughts on web development topics.

## Design Principles

- **Minimalism**: Keep it simple and avoid cluttering the page
- **Typography**: Use clear, readable fonts with good hierarchy
- **Color palette**: Stick to 2-3 main colors plus neutrals
- **Whitespace**: Don't be afraid of empty space
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure your site looks great on all devices

## Performance Optimization

- Use CSS modules or Tailwind for styling
- Lazy load images and components
- Minify your assets
- Use a CDN for static files

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio with React and Vite gives you a solid foundation for showcasing your skills. Remember to keep it clean, focused, and regularly update it with your latest work.

Happy building!
