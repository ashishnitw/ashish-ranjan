title: AI: The Expectation Trap

In the world of software development, a new narrative is taking hold: "Everyone is an architect now." With AI coding agents handling the heavy lifting of implementation, the industry's focus is shifting from writing code to thinking about code.

But is this "leveling up" actually a career advancement, or is it a repeat of a historical pattern that leaves developers doing more for less?

This isn't the first time the industry has "empowered" engineers with more responsibility. We’ve seen this cycle before:
- The Full-Stack Era: About 15 years ago, the industry merged front-end and back-end roles into the "Full-Stack Engineer." While it sounded like a way to become more versatile, it often meant companies collapsed two roles into one, doubling the scope of work while keeping the paycheck roughly the same.
- The DevOps Revolution: The "you build it, you run it" philosophy gave developers more ownership. In practice, it meant developers were now on call for production issues, managing CI/CD pipelines, and debugging Kubernetes on top of their feature work.

Today, we are seeing the AI version of this pattern. Mid-level engineers can use AI to scaffold systems, generate diagrams, and produce impressive output quickly.

However, this leads to **Title Inflation**. When everyone is expected to perform at a "Staff" or "Architect" level, those titles begin to lose their value. Companies may realize they can get "Staff-level output" from mid-level engineers, reducing the need for promotions or hiring actual Staff Engineers.

The prevailing wisdom is that the engineers who thrive will be those who can manage context—knowing the business domain and how the whole system fits together. Context isn't learned through prompting; it’s earned through years of implementation, debugging, and living with the consequences of bad architectural decisions.

If we automate the "easy" part (coding) for junior developers, we risk a knowledge crisis. Without the "grunt work" of implementation, how will the next generation develop the judgment required for high-level architectural thinking?

AI doesn't just change what you do; it changes how fast you’re expected to do it. If an AI can generate code in minutes, managers expect a ship-ready feature in hours. While generation is fast, human thinking is not. Reviewing AI-generated code for subtle bugs, edge cases, and architectural fit often takes more time because you're auditing logic you didn't write.

### How to Navigate the Trap

This isn't an anti-AI stance—AI tools are incredibly useful. It is a call to be skeptical of narratives that primarily benefit employers.

When AI delivers a "mess" that you have to clean up, treat it like a teammate. Tell your manager exactly how long the review and integration took.

Don't just be a "propmter." Deeply understand the why behind the code AI generates. Context remains the only true differentiator in a world where code generation is a commodity

Use AI to assist you, but don't let it replace the learning process. You must "earn the right" to make architectural decisions by understanding the implementation details.
